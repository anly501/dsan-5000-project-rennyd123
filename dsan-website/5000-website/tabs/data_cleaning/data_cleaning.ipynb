    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of the time when we look for data on the internet, it is not going to be in the format that we need it to be in, in order to analyse it properly for our goals. Othertimes, the data set is incomplete including missing data points, has inconsistent formatting, or is in a format that does not work for smooth analysis. That is there data cleaning comes in. Cleaning our \"dirty\" data helps us ensure that the data is ready to be analyzed and that the data we do analyze is accurate and reliable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Common data cleaning tasks for tabular data include deciding how to deal with missing values, duplicate rows or entries, incorrect values, special characters, etc. Additionally, it involves accounting for inconsistent casting (having inconsistent instances of upper and lowercase letters), spelling errors, human errors, inconsistent units, and more. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will know that a tabular data set is clean when every column is a variable, every row is an observation,and every call is a value.   \n",
    "\n",
    "When we clean text data, we often us Natural Language Processing, or NLP. Common cleaning tasks include removing punctuation, dealing with special characters, tokenization, vectorization, stop word removal, lemmatization or stemming, spell check, removing URLs, and more. \n",
    "\n",
    "To help us clean data, we can use R packages such as Tidyverse, dplyr, forcats, tidyr, etc. For Python, we can use packages such as Pandas, RegEx, and NLTK. I utilize Pandas quite a bit in the data cleaning process. I use both R and Python to clean my data."

I also decided to drop all of the rows with NaN values because it is clear to me that there is data missing in those rows due to the story of the injury not making sense. For example, there was one row where someone had a pre-season injury so they did not miss any weeks, but they had missing values for both play time before and anfer the injury.
