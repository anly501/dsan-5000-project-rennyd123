    "In this project, I used a variety of data sets regarding injuries and injury prevention in sports. I used both record and text data. The data sets came from sources such as academic articles, Kaggle from users who had already created sports related data sets from respective sports websites such as the NFL and NBA or from competitions hosted by professional sports leagues, statistical institutes, APIs, and data.world.\n",
    "\n",
    "While I have a lot of data sets, I didn't use all of them in my main analysis. Because injuries in sports don't gain a ton of media attention if they aren't big, career ending types of injuries, I wanted to provide a little more context for the injuries that do occur before diving into what we can do to prevent them. My data sets are focused on three main sports: football (or soccer, but I will use football throughout the course of this project), basketball, and American football. I decided to use three sports for my exploratory data analysis to see how the nature of injuries differs between sports.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The data set that is used for my main analysis is about injury prevention factors. More about this data set can be found below, and throughout the other data related tabs on my website, but I thought this data set would be a valuable one to focus on and would be the one to answer the questions in my introduction that are guiding the course of this project.

    "The next data set that I decided to explore is a NBA Injury Data set. This data set records all of the roster moves related to injuries made by each NBA team in every season betwwen the 2010 and 2020 seasons. The raw data contains 5 features, including player name, team name, date of transaction, acquired players, relinquished players, and notes about the injury. I thought this data source would be useful to help gather information about what kinds of injuries are most common and how many injuries each team had per season. The raw data set comes from this [Kaggle data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ghopkins/nba-injuries-2010-2018/code) who scraped it from the [Pro Sports Transactions](http://www.prosportstransactions.com/) website.
