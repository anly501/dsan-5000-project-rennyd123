    "- A brief proposal outlining your projectâ€™s objectives, dataset selection, and the tools or libraries you plan to use (e.g., Python, scikit-learn).\n",

    "The objective of my project is to explore what factors can affect athletes ability to get injuries. There are various factors that can be involved, such as how an athlete warms up, the nature of the position or sport that they play, the location that they play in or on, etc. My goal is to explore if any factors have positive correlations with injuries so that athletes can be sure to do what they can avoid injury. For this section of the paper, I've decided to use a dataset regarding injuries that soccer players have. "
